##MUST HAVE

####Homepage

* write javascript/jQuery so that when a character is hovered over, the hero-shot image and information changes below
* hyperlink each character to the game view, passing in params data
* Build lots of design and functionality (backgrounds, navs, etc)

####Comments
* Weâ€™re loosely modelling our homepage on this: http://au.jsconf.com/
 images, colours, and sprites are placeholders only at this point. They should match the visual style of our game.
* This is a good site to pixelate your face: http://superpixeltime.com/


####Game/Canvas


####Sidebar/Resume

* Display content based user ID when routed from homepage.  
* Be hidden until revealed by game event.

####Rails/Backend

* establish routes and pass info from home to players game instance. 

###Misc

* create individual space-themed sprites for each of us
* prevent phaser.js from running when not necessary
